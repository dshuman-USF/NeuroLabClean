2020-02-17  dshuman@usf.edu

	* lots of files: add in gpl header to make nice with github.
	* Makefile.am: git targets.

2017-10-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: move old version to SOURCES/old dir.

2017-07-17  dale@health.usf.edu

	* do_clean_data2.m: workaround for bug in latest version of octave, 4.2.1.
	* debian/control: remove reference to hardening-wrapper, it is provided by
	other means.

2015-11-10  dale@health.usf.edu

	* make_chan.sh: add in empty chanlists 9 and 10 for an experiment that needed 9
	separate chan lists (and add in 10 just because).
	* clean_rec.sh: add in 9 & 10 list handling.
	* configure.ac: rollup to 1.10.10

2015-08-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* do_clean_data2.m: Invoke octave in command line mode.  Version 4.0 starts
	up in GUI mode, which makes errors out for scripts with no GUI
	requirements.
	* debian/control: add in some octave dependencies

2015-01-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: add --allow-unauthenticated flag so source will
	be downloaded.

2014-07-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Daq2CleanUsersManual.odt:  LSegers updates to the manual.
	* configure.ac: Bump up to 1.10.7

2014-04-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: fix bug, should be .dsc, not _dsc
	* Makefile.am: remove bldpkg target, releasepkg script does this now.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.10.6

2014-03-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* do_clean_data2.m: Was sending wrong count to CleanData, only 1/2 the matrix 
	was being cleaned.  fread returns # of items (shorts in this case), not bytes.
	* configure.ac: Bump up to 1.10.5

2014-03-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* do_clean_data2.m: fix dir create race condition.  Don't test, then try to
	make, try to make, then test.  If the dir is there, we're happy no matter
	which instance made it.
	* do_noclean_data.sh: Same race condtion, same fix.
	* do_clean_data2.m: Add check to make sure in and out files are same size.
	The 1.10.3 fix should ensure this will not happen, but it can't hurt to
	check.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.10.4

2014-03-11  dale@health.usf.edu

	* do_clean_data2.m: Octave 3.8 changes how fread works.  If you ask for X
	bytes but only get X-n bytes back, the length of the vector you read into
	is X bytes.  This breaks CleanData.m.  Now pass in the channels matrix with
	explicit size for # of rows.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.10.3

2014-01-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Updates to build debian packages.
	* configure.ac: version 1.10.2.

2013-11-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* make_chan.sh: addin chans 120-123 to noclean list

2013-10-25  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: add daq_to_bin.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.10.0

2013-10-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* daq_to_bin.c: Create.  The split dirs are not always present, so go
	straight to the source.
	* chans_to_bin.c: Fix bug where SelList not initialized to select all chans.

2013-09-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* make_chan.sh: Add in support for new chan organization on second daq
	card.  Since we want to make chan lists for both older and newer chan
	assignments, this now prompts for input.

2013-08-09  dale@health.usf.edu

	* chans_to_bin.c: create this to combine a set of chan files into a single
	binary image that can be imported into the CED Spike2 program.

2013-03-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* make_chan.sh: uncomment Neptune chans.

2012-12-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Daq2CleanUsersManual.odt:   Correct spelling of make_lable.sh in short
	form section.  This is for the version 1.7 package, already released, will
	replace earlier copies.

2012-12-13  dale@health.usf.edu

	* clean_rec.sh: isolate tests for 2 params so shell does not complain.
	* make_chan.sh: remove nerve chans from chanlist 6, dups of 57-60 and
	should not be cleaned together.

2012-10-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* daq2_unsplit.c: add to the packages for version 1.6

2012-09-10  dale@health.usf.edu

	* make_chan.sh: redo files and contents as requested.

2012-05-31  dale@health.usf.edu

	* clean_rec.sh: modify to accept optional param to handle old datamax chan
	files.  This passes on down the chain so do_clean_data2.m does not expect a
	_r_ in the raw chan filenames.
	* do_clean_data.sh: ditto
	* make_chan.sh: Fix bug in how noclean list filename was created.
	* Daq2CleanUsersManual.*:  Update to reflect --no_r param change.

2012-05-08  dale@health.usf.edu

	* daq2_split.c: Spelling error.

2012-03-22  dale  <dale@kali>

	* Start the ChangeLog file
